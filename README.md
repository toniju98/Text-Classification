## General Information
In this project, we handle text data, following the typical workflow of many machine learning tasks. The initial step involves reading in data from .json files containing news articles. Once the data is loaded into a dataframe, the cleaning process begins, utilizing Spacy. This includes tasks like lowercasing all articles and reducing them to nouns, as nouns tend to convey the most meaning when categorizing text. Following data cleaning, it undergoes vectorization for machine learning, with the TF-IDF Vectorizer being employed. Subsequently, the data is used to train a machine learning model, offering the flexibility to test various models. The classification performance is then assessed.
